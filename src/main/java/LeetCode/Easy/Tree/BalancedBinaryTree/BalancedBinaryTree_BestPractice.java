 * based on DFS.
 * Instead of calling depth() explicitly for each child node, we return the height of the current node in DFS recursion.
 * When the sub tree of the current node (inclusive) is balanced, the function dfsHeight() returns a non-negative value as the height. Otherwise -1 is returned.
 * According to the leftHeight and rightHeight of the two children, the parent node could check if the sub tree is balanced, and decides its return value.
