 * You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product.
 * Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check.
 * Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
 * <p>
 * Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.
 * <p>
 * You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version.
 * You should minimize the number of calls to the API.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <p>
 * Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.
 * <p>
 * call isBadVersion(3) -> false
 * call isBadVersion(5) -> true
 * call isBadVersion(4) -> true
 * <p>
 * Then 4 is the first bad version.
 * <p>
 * The isBadVersion API is defined in the parent class {@link VersionControl}.
 * boolean isBadVersion(int version);
